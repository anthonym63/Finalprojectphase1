# Overview
I'm working on this project for my company. They're thinking about getting into the aviation business, like buying planes for commercial and private use. But they don't know much about the risks, like which planes have the most accidents or are the safest. My job is to look at this data from the National Transportation Safety Board and figure out which aircraft have the lowest risk.
# Business Problem
My goal is to figure out which aircraft are the safest for the company to buy. I am looking at accident data to find the lowest risk options.
# Data
I'm using the National Transportation Safety Board Aviation Accident Dataset. 
- Aviation.Data_csv
  
Methods and Exploration

For an indepth analysis of the dataset, the cleaning and analsysis of the datasets was done in a separate notebook project.ipynb as to not make this one long.
I used two key methods of analysis on the dataset above:
Descriptive Analysis: I used to aggregate past accident records by aircraft make and model, calculate average risk scores, and rank aircraft to identify those with consistently lower accident severity.
